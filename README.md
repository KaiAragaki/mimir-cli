# mimir-cli

It is quite fortunate that you stumbled upon Mimir's head in the midst of your travels through dimly lit laboratories. While time has not been kind to him (for his head is all that remains, body long since divorced), his memory is still flawless. In exchange for his liberation of poorly-washed glassware, Mimir has agreed to help remember the results of your lab results.

Mimir has agreed to do the following:
- Take in your untidy lab results and turn it into tidy, tabular data
- Take these tidy results and add remember them for all eternity
- Guide you through the treacherous process of experiment design logging
- Help you associate said designs with said results
- Automatically determine when you have brought new results to him and help you through the process of adding them to his memory.

You have asked Mimir about the source of his powerful memory, but unfortunately he only says nonsense words (which you assume to be Old Norse). However, you wrote down what you heard in case a future traveler is able to translate:

- Written in Go using the Bubbletea framework
- Backed by a MySQL database

Mimir in hand, you are galvanized to leap into the uncharted territory of the experimental sciences.
